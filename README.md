#### Test case 1 
+ time series DB 
+ message broker
+ Security : 
  + establish firewall, SSL 
  + audit logs 
  + add program : fail2ban, mod-security 
+ Rule engine logic 
  + Node RED flow based approach 
  + Flow sequence 
  
+ Production deployment pipeline : could test with digital ocean with many options for IoT platform 
  
+ IoT platform API:
